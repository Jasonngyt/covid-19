# Covid19 World Tracker
On 31 December 2019, WHO was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, China. A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause by Chinese authorities on 7 January 2020 and was temporarily named “2019-nCoV”. <br> <br>

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The new virus was subsequently named the “COVID-19 virus”<br><br>

This wesbite is set up to raise awareness fo the virus. The number of virus cases, deaths and recovered numbers will be shown in the Google Map.

Breakdown figures can also be shown through the search by the Country Names.

#### The Wesbite is general working but require some CSS touchup. I will deploy this site once everything is ready. Do stay tune!
#### Meanwhile, you are free to clone the project to check it out.
